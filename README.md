## Abstract
This repository contains an implementation of AnonNet, our submission to the School of AI Hackathon on March 31st, 2019. AnonNet detects key identifying features on a person's face, i.e., the eyes, eyebrows, and mouth. Using this information, accurate pixelation and/or censor bar placement can de-identify an individual. This has several benefits, including but not limited to:
- Reducing the risk of protected patient information from being leaked
- Reducing the administrative burden of manually de-identifying patient information
- Increasing the availability and access to anonymized information, leading to innovation in the Healthcare space

## Instructions to Reproduce
In order to replicate the AnonNet Jupyter Notebook, you'll need to install `Node.js`.
